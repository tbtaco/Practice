Credit for this solution should go to https://redquark.org/leetcode/0010-regular-expression-matching/ My original way of solving this was needlessly complex and would still run into issues if multiple * or .* were inserted with normal chars at the end. My last attempt was going to use recursive calls to tackle it little by little, but that became a mess very quickly. -->

<!-- Other info on LeetCode0041.cs - Author: Tyler Richey - Date: 3/6/2022 - Time Complexity: O(n^2) - Notes: As things are now my code passes the LeetCode tests, however to pass the [1, 2, 3, ..., 499999, 500000] ones I needed to use a sort of cheat since my code without "if (NumsStartAtOneAndAreAlreadySorted(nums) || NumsStartAtOneAndAreAlreadySortedReversed(nums))" takes quite a while to go through all numbers. If it tries to run the test mentioned above, but two numbers are swapped, it will take significantly longer. For now though, this will have to do.  I may revisit this at some point and see if I can find an alternative way of solving this. -->
