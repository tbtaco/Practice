This repository is where I'll be saving my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.

I started working on these practice problems in June of 2021 and plan to continue solving one or two a week when I have some spare time.

[Program.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/Program.cs) - The starting point for this group of programs.  It's a simple switch/case block to run different LeetCode solutions.

[LeetCode0002.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0002.cs) - Medium - Add two numbers stored as linked lists, and return as a linked list.

[LeetCode0003.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0003.cs) - Medium - Return the longest substring without repeating characters.

[LeetCode0004.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0004.cs) - Hard - Given two sorted arrays, return the median.

[LeetCode0005.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0005.cs) - Medium - Given a string, return the longest palindromic substring.

[LeetCode0006.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0006.cs) - Medium - Take a string and convert it to a zig-zag version.  Easier to explain by showing an example.

[LeetCode0007.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0007.cs) - Easy - Reverse the digits of an integer.

[LeetCode0008.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0008.cs) - Medium - Given a string, return the integer portion that the string starts with (if possible).  Creates a sort of ATOI() function.

[LeetCode0009.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0009.cs) - Easy - Return a boolean to say if an integer is a palindrome.

[LeetCode0010.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0010.cs) - Hard - Regular expression matching.  I had troubles with this one and ended up seeking help to complete it.  See comments for further explanation.

[LeetCode0011.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0011.cs) - Medium - Given a list of integers representing heights and locations of barriers, return the max area/volume possible between barriers.  "Container With Most Water"

[LeetCode0012.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0012.cs) - Medium - Integer to Roman Numeral.

[LeetCode0013.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0013.cs) - Easy - Roman Numeral to Integer.

[LeetCode0014.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0014.cs) - Easy - Longest common prefix.

[LeetCode0015.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0015.cs) - Medium - Given an integer array, return all triplets such that an indice is only used once per grouping, and the sum of the three is zero.

[LeetCode0016.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0016.cs) - Medium - Similar to [LeetCode0015.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0015.cs) but instead of returning all triplets, I return only the sum of the triplet closest to zero.

[LeetCode0017.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0017.cs) - Medium - Given an input of numbers saved as a string, return all possible combinations of letter mappings as if it were keyed into a phone.

[LeetCode0018.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0018.cs) - Medium - Same as [LeetCode0015.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0015.cs) except with 4 numbers, not 3.  As more numbers are added, timing becomes a larger factor.

[LeetCode0019.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0019.cs) - Medium - Remove the Nth node from a linked list.

[LeetCode0020.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0020.cs) - Easy - Check for valid parentheses.

[LeetCode0021.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0021.cs) - Easy - Merge two sorted lists.

[LeetCode0022.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0022.cs) - Medium - Given an integer, generate a list containing all combinations of valid parentheses using that number of opening/closing parentheses pairs.

[LeetCode0023.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0023.cs) - Hard - Merge a list of sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

[LeetCode0024.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0024.cs) - Medium - Swap nodes in pairs.

[LeetCode0025.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0025.cs) - Hard - Similar to [LeetCode0024.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0024.cs) but instead of swapping 2 nodes, I reverse the order of k nodes.  If the total number of nodes isn't divisible by k, leave the remainder as is.

[LeetCode0026.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0026.cs) - Easy - Remove duplicates from a sorted array.

[LeetCode0027.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0027.cs) - Easy - Similar to [LeetCode0026.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0026.cs) but I'm removing a specific number instead of duplicates.

[LeetCode0028.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0028.cs) - Easy - Return the first occurrence of a substring, or -1 if the substring isn't part of the string.  "Needle in Haystack"

[LeetCode0029.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0029.cs) - Medium - Divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operators.  My solution for this works, but is too slow for the LeetCode test cases.  I'll return to this someday and redo it.

[LeetCode0030.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0030.cs) - Hard - Given a string and an array of string words, return all starting indices where the words can be concatenated to equal a substring of the original string.

[LeetCode0031.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0031.cs) - Medium - Next Permutation.  Given a list of integers that represent a number, rearrange the numbers to create the next highest number.  If it's already the highest, rearrange into the lowest number.

[LeetCode0032.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0032.cs) - Hard - Return the longest length of a valid parentheses substring.

[LeetCode0033.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0033.cs) - Medium - Search for a number in a rotated sorted array.

[LeetCode0034.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0034.cs) - Medium - Find the first and last position of a target int in a sorted array of ints.

[LeetCode0035.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0035.cs) - Easy - Return the position in a sorted array that a target number is either found, or would be inserted in order.

[LeetCode0036.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0036.cs) - Medium - Check that a Sudoku board is valid.  Rows, Columns, and Blocks must contain only 1-9 without repetition.  This does not check that the puzzle is solvable, only that the numbers given are valid.

[LeetCode0037.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0037.cs) - Hard - Continuing from [LeetCode0036.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0036.cs), this one actually solves Sudoku puzzles.  There are easier and lazier ways of eventually getting the result through trial and error, but I opted to put some effort into this one as I enjoy Sudoku.  For this one, I got to use a lot of loops, create several methods, recursion, and even decided it'd make more sense to create a class to represent a Sudoku cell so I can assign data to each cell more clearly and have functions run per cell instead of always modifying other objects when it's unnecessary.  This one would be a great one to look at to see some of my programming skills.

[LeetCode0038.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0038.cs) - Medium - Count and say.

[LeetCode0039.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0039.cs) - Medium - Returns all combinations of an int array that can be added to equal a target int.

[LeetCode0040.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0040.cs) - Medium - Added but not attempted yet.

[LeetCode0041.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0041.cs) - Hard - Added but not attempted yet.

[LeetCode0042.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/LeetCode0042.cs) - Hard - Added but not attempted yet.
