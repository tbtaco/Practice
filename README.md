This repository is where I'll be saving my solutions to [LeetCode](leetcode.com) problems.

I started working on these practice problems in June of 2021 and plan to continue solving a couple each week in my spare time.

The file [Program.cs](github.com/tbtaco/Practice/blob/master/Practice/Program.cs) is the starting point, and from there I can input a number to test run that specific LeetCode solution.
